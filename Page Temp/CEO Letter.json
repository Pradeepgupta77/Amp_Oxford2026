families and institutions choose Oxford, they are making more than a financial decision. They are affirming a relationship built on trust, shared values and a vision that stretches well beyond their own lifetimes. Each year when you continue to place your confidence in us, you are once again choosing Oxford as a steward of your legacy. That is both an extraordinary privilege and a profound responsibility\u2014one we never take for granted.<\/p><p>Legacy is by nature forward-looking. For many of you, personal needs are already well provided for. The work we do together focuses on what comes next: children, grandchildren, charitable endeavors and the communities you care about most. It involves estate strategies, governance structures, philanthropy, investment decisions and private equity solutions all designed not for the next year but for decades, even generations. Helping you define, protect and advance your legacy is at the very heart of our work.<\/p><p>To do this well, Oxford must also safeguard its own legacy. You can only entrust your future to us if you believe our firm is consistent and principled. More than 30 years ago, we created a trust structure that prevents Oxford from ever being sold to a bank, brokerage or private equity firm. That decision, novel at the time, has become one of the most important foundations of our identity. Our structure is specifically designed to help keep Oxford privately held, minimizing outside pressures that can push firms toward short-term decision-making at the expense of long-term stewardship.<\/p><p>This independence allows us to focus on what matters most: continuity, culture and client impact. The average age of our Partners is in the early 40s, and leadership has already transitioned across multiple generations. Today, Oxford is guided by a strong partner group that aims to carry the firm forward for the next 25 years and beyond. We view succession not as a single event, but as an ongoing discipline, continually refined so that Oxford\u2019s legacy endures just as surely as yours.<\/p><p>We believe our independence helps enable us to attract and retain well-qualified people. Talented professionals across our industry are weary of constant restructuring, mergers and sales that disrupt culture and compromise service. At Oxford, we offer ownership, stability and a culture that values creativity and decisiveness. We maintain the ability to make thoughtful decisions efficiently, allowing us to adapt and meet client needs promptly. This entrepreneurial mindset keeps us agile, combined with a steadfast commitment to integrity and thoughtful guidance.<\/p><p>Over time, Oxford has become more than an advisory firm. We strive to foster a positive environment for colleagues and a distinctive service experience for clients. Inside the firm, we promote a workplace where people are proud of their work, empowered to share ideas and united by a culture that is stronger and more vibrant than ever. For our clients, this can translate into a service experience that is seamless, personal and distinctive without being pretentious. We are committed to delivering high-quality advice and service with a quiet, understated approach: The familiarity of a trusted concierge, the comfort of a favorite restaurant where the staff remembers your order and the enduring quality of something beautifully made that grows more valuable with time.<\/p><p>This combination of stability, creativity and service distinguishes Oxford from banks, brokerages and private equity-backed firms. While others are often guided by the demands of external shareholders, Oxford\u2019s purpose remains clear. We aim to provide the continuity and expertise you need to protect and advance your family\u2019s legacy. We seek to earn enough to sustain excellence, not to maximize profits for external owners. We believe that alignment of values makes all the difference.<\/p><p>I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the people who make this possible. Our partners and colleagues bring extraordinary dedication to their work. They embody the culture we treasure and extend the Oxford Difference to every client relationship. Their passion and professionalism are the true foundation of our legacy.<\/p><p>Finally, I want to extend my deepest thanks to you: our clients, colleagues, advisors and friends. Your confidence is never taken for granted. Each time you choose to work with us, you affirm the belief that legacies matter and that together we can safeguard them. Your legacy is in every meaningful way our legacy.<\/p><p>As Oxford enters its 45th year, I am more confident than ever that our best chapters are ahead. With independence as our compass and stewardship as our calling, we remain committed to serving you and the generations to come.<\/p><p>With gratitude,<br \/><img src=\"https:\/\/2026.ofgltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2023\/12\/jht-signature.png\" \/><br \/><em>Jeffrey H.
