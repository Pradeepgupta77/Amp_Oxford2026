These strategies are designed and executed by our in-house investment team, built upon decades of experience, deep relationships and a singular focus: aligning client capital with exceptional talent and enduring value creation.<\/p><p><strong>The Power of Alignment and Access<\/strong><\/p><p>Many successful private investments begin with alignment\u2014between investors and managers, between capital and conviction. At Oxford, we believe alignment of interests is not just a desirable feature but the foundation of superior performance.<\/p><p>Through our Regent Street strategy, we partner with talented and experienced private equity professionals launching their own firms, often after ten to twenty years of success at well-known private equity houses. These emerging managers are sector specialists with proven track records and personal capital at risk.<\/p><p>By serving as an anchor investor and early partner, Oxford helps these managers establish their firms while securing privileged access and economics for our clients. The combination of entrepreneurial drive, focused expertise and meaningful alignment is intentionally designed to produce strong results across market cycles. For our clients, our goal is that Regent Street offers access to tomorrow\u2019s leading investors today.<\/p><p><strong>Investing Shoulder to Shoulder<\/strong><\/p><p>Our Co-Investment strategy extends Oxford\u2019s reach from the fund level to the company level. By investing directly alongside the general partners we know best\u2014both from Regent Street relationships and our network of independent sponsors\u2014we participate in select opportunities on a deal-by-deal basis.<\/p><p>These are minority, non-control investments in established, growing businesses. Every opportunity undergoes the same rigorous underwriting process we apply to our own funds and direct investments. The result is a portfolio that is highly selective, deeply informed and often can be accessed at more favorable fee structures than traditional fund investing allows.<\/p><p><strong>Owning the Opportunity<\/strong><\/p><p>Through Mayfair, Oxford takes the next step by leading investments directly and acting as the general partner. Here, we make control or significant minority investments in middle-market businesses, focusing on growth-oriented companies that we believe possess high-quality management teams, strong cash flow characteristics and defensible competitive advantages.<\/p><p>Mayfair reflects Oxford\u2019s long-term perspective and disciplined approach to value creation. We invest patient, committed capital that allows management teams to pursue strategic growth without the artificial constraints of a traditional fund structure. Our involvement is hands-on where it matters most\u2014at the board and strategic levels\u2014ensuring alignment from governance to growth.<\/p><p><strong>Unlocking the Private Market Edge<\/strong><\/p><p>Private markets have long been recognized for their ability to generate superior returns through active ownership, strategic transformation and flexible time horizons. Yet, we believe that true success in this domain requires something rarer than capital: access.<\/p><p>Oxford\u2019s platform offers that access, not to crowded or commoditized segments, but to corners of the private markets where we believe specialization, alignment and partnership create opportunities for meaningful outperformance.<\/p><p>Through Regent Street, Co-Investment and Mayfair Capital Partners, Oxford clients gain entry to a continuum of private investment opportunities. Each is distinct in structure and strategy yet unified by a common purpose: to capture the benefits of private ownership through alignment, expertise and disciplined execution.<\/p><p><strong>Building for the Long Term<\/strong><\/p><p>As families and institutions look beyond public markets for growth and diversification, Oxford\u2019s private markets platform stands as a bridge between opportunity and access. Our long-term fiduciary mindset ensures each investment is evaluated for potential returns, alignment with client values and achievement of long-term goals.<\/p><p>Private Markets, Private Access is more than a title\u2014it is a philosophy. It reflects how Oxford unlocks unique opportunities by combining access to highly qualified managers, participation in selective co-investments and leadership in direct investing.<\/p><p>This is Oxford\u2019s way of transforming private access into enduring value.<\/p>","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":36,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"400","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=64e95d4","_background_color":""},"text_shadow_text_shadow":{"horizontal":0,"vertical":0,"blur":12,"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)"},"pa_condition_repeater":[{"_id":"cc26f2d"}],"text_color":"#000000","_background_background":"classic","align_mobile":"left"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":true,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":true,"elType":"section"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"}],"page_settings":[],"version":"0.4","title":"The Oxford Way &#8211; Private Markets Private Access &#8211; Page Template","type":"section"}
