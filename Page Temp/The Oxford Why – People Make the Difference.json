Every relationship, every success story and every lasting client partnership comes back to the talent, integrity and care of those who choose to build their careers here. That truth was reaffirmed in 2025, as we welcomed a remarkable group of colleagues whose skills and perspectives further strengthen Oxford\u2019s culture and sharpen our ability to serve clients.<\/p><p>This year marked another step in expanding our Managing Director ranks in key markets. In Grand Rapids, we welcomed <strong>Tania DeVries<\/strong>, a proven leader with deep client experience. <strong>Michele Hargis <\/strong>and<strong> Neal Davis<\/strong> joined in Cincinnati, adding strength to a growing region. In Palm Beach, <strong>Chris Gioia<\/strong> brought his valuable family office experience to our team, further strengthening Oxford\u2019s depth and presence in the market. Each brings decades of wisdom and relationships that will help benefit our multigenerational families for years to come.<\/p><p>Oxford also grew its senior leadership with the addition of <strong>Russ DeLibero<\/strong> in Atlanta. As Chief Wealth Planning Officer, Russ brings over 20 years of experience advising ultra-high-net-worth families and is known for making complex planning clear and accessible. <strong>Alex Neff<\/strong> joined as Chief Marketing Officer to advance Oxford\u2019s marketing and branding strategy.<\/p><p>We also invested in talent to enhance Oxford\u2019s strategic and analytical capabilities. <strong>Matt Hill<\/strong> joined as Director of Financial Planning &amp; Analysis and Strategic Finance, <strong>Wesley Howard<\/strong> became our Business Development Analyst in Atlanta and <strong>Chip Stapleton<\/strong> came aboard as Senior Financial Analyst of Strategic Finance &amp; Business Insights. Together, they bring rigor to the firm\u2019s financial planning and decision-making.<\/p><p>In addition to the talent above, Oxford has expanded its team by adding <strong>twelve client service and administrative support associates<\/strong> across the firm\u2019s seven offices. These hires highlight our commitment not just to growth but to the client experience itself, ensuring that every interaction reflects Oxford\u2019s culture of care and continuity.<\/p><p>What unites these professionals is more than impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. They were drawn to Oxford\u2019s independence and culture, attracted by the chance to do their life\u2019s work in an environment focused on clients rather than outside ownership interests. For our clients, that means a consistent philosophy, a long-term perspective and continued alignment with Oxford\u2019s founding mission.<\/p><p>As we look ahead, we know strategies will evolve and markets will shift. But the constant, and defining factor, will always be people. In welcoming these new colleagues, we not only strengthen our capabilities today but also affirm the culture that makes Oxford unique. It is a culture where talent thrives, clients are served for generations and legacies\u2014both yours and ours\u2014endure.<\/p>","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":36,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"400","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=64e95d4","_background_color":""},"text_shadow_text_shadow":{"horizontal":0,"vertical":0,"blur":12,"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)"},"pa_condition_repeater":[{"_id":"cc26f2d"}],"text_color":"#000000","_background_background":"classic","align_mobile":"left"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":true,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":true,"elType":"section"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"},{"id":"17a9a4f6","settings":{"_column_size":50,"_inline_size":39.987,"pa_condition_repeater":[{"_id":"a346f1b"}],"align":"flex-start","margin":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":false},"content_position":"bottom","_inline_size_tablet":100,"_inline_size_mobile":100,"margin_mobile":{"unit":"%","top":"","right":"","bottom":"","left":"","isLinked":true},"margin_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":false},"background_background":"classic","_element_id":"full_img_con_2026","__globals__":{"background_color":"globals\/colors?id=64e95d4"},"padding":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":false},"background_image":{"url":"https:\/\/2026.ofgltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/17\/2025\/01\/great-wall-of-china-1.jpg","id":14726,"size":"","alt":"","source":"library"},"background_position":"bottom center","background_repeat":"no-repeat","background_size":"cover","_title":"IMG","background_image_tablet":{"url":"https:\/\/2026.ofgltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/17\/2025\/01\/20.jpg","id":14728,"size":"","alt":"","source":"library"},"background_image_mobile":{"url":"https:\/\/2026.ofgltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/17\/2025\/01\/great-wall-of-china-1.jpg","id":14726,"size":"","alt":"","source":"library"}},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"}],"page_settings":[],"version":"0.4","title":"The Oxford Why &#8211; People Make the Difference &#8211; Page Template","type":"section"}
